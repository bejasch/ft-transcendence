# When running make dev, the variables HTTP_PORT, HTTPS_PORT, SITES
# will be set depending on these variables:
DEV_HTTP_PORT=8080
DEV_HTTPS_PORT=8443
DEV_SITES=http://localhost
# Can also be multiple domains:
# DEV_SITES=http://localhost http://ip6-localhost

# IMPORTANT: For the `dev-tls` make target, you can't put IP literals in the SITES variable, unless
#            you only put exactly one and also make it https, in which case you need to set default_sni
#            in the Caddyfile, see https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/6344

# When running make prod, the variables HTTP_PORT, HTTPS_PORT, SITES
